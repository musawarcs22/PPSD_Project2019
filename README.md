The ultimate goal of this collaborative project was to familiarize overselves with git hub. We proactively worked in a group of three people. 

We have made a HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM with an easy to use interface. We are using a text file to store our records.
Different functionalities of our system are listed below:-
1)Adding a record
2)Deleting as record using ID
3)Searching a record using ID
4)Displaying the list of customers
5)Complaint Section

We have worked together in separate branches as well in master branch. 
We efficiently performed merging of separate branches, push operations, commits, pull operations and file handling, etc.
We have properly learned to use the Git and Git hub with the help of this project.

Note: PPt slides of our proposal presentation are uploaded as well as the link of our final slides is also uploaded in our repository. 

All the other files we worked with in the course of properly completing this collaborative project are also uploaded.
